## Presentation

### Topic
Can the sucess of a movie be predicted based on certain factors?

### Why we selected the topic.
The group chose this topic for a few different reasons.  The first reason was that there was a pretty meaningful dataset. We were able to explore and discuss different possible options for our project.
The data we were able to find also needed minimal cleaning to analyze and come up with an agreeable topic to discuss.
The data was also meaningful enough to allow us to come up with practical and everyday uses that anyone could find useful.

### Source of our data

The dataset was found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies).
