# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis

To clean and analyze the data Pandas will be used.  Python will be used for further analysis.

## Database Storage

Postgres database is what will be used to store the data. As the data is continues to be analyzed, the group will determine which vizulations will be most effective (i.e. graphs, charts) for displaying the data.

## Machine Learning

SciKitLearn  will be used using a multi-linear regression model to train and test the data. 

## Dashboard

For the dashboard portion of the project we will be using Dash, which provides a Python interface for interactive web-based components.
